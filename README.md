# Digital Krishi Officer (MVP) â€” Node.js + Gemini API

This project is a **prototype AI-powered agricultural advisory system**. Farmers can ask questions (currently in English) about crops, pests, fertilizers, or schemes, and get context-aware answers from the **Gemini API**. Later, Malayalam support, image uploads, and RAG (document retrieval) can be added.
